Transfer a single file F in the LAN between NoFS users
- user A adds file F to NoFS
- NoFS tells user A the content ID of F
- user A tells user B the content ID of F
- instances A and B discover each other in the LAN
- user B asks her NoFS to check out the file F with the given ID
- instance B broadcasts a request for the content ID of file F
- instance A responds that it has file F
- instance B downloads file F from instance A
- instance B checks out file F for user B

Add several files as an archive (ZIP, ISO, TAR etc)
- the user adds the archive A to NoFS asking for deep inspection
- NoFS guesses the file type as an archive because of a characteristic header
- NoFS adds the files from the archive recursively
- NoFS creates a directory object that describes the inner structure of the archive
- NoFS adds the archive as a whole
- NoFS tells the user about the directory and the archive being added
- the user can immediately use the directory or contained file contents
